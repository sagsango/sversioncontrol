We should strart from the scratch.
1. commits seems like just snapshot 
2. we can just save whole files in the snapshot without any optimization
3. we can do optimization based on if file was present in the last commit 
  - we should first create the whole file from the metadata store in the last snapshot or commit
  - then we should store the metadata in current commit/snapshot which is the diff from the previous file version
  - we can take diff blockwise or byte-range-wise etc.
